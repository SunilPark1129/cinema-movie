## Project Description
Cinema Movie fetches movie information from The Movie Database and shares the information with users on a new platform. You can search for a movie through this website or click on a recommended movie to find that information. I focused more on various functions and visual design to give the feeling of easily finding information about the movie.

## Features
|Feature|Screenshots / Description|
|:--:|:--|
|Scroll Event|<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106734133/174793737-4a9dba02-a9bc-4c75-816c-a69945b4ce74.gif" alt="Scroll Event" height="300"/><br>Previously, an event was automatically triggered when the user's scroll position value was reached. This time, unlike other projects, I put on the element styling:<br><br>```style={{transform: `translate3d(${element.getBoundingClientRect().top / 10}px, 0, 0px)`, opacity: `${element.getBoundingClientRect().top === 0 ? 1:1 - (element.getBoundingClientRect().top / 3 * .01)}`}}```<br><br> This allows the user to see the smooth animation effect in its current progressive form whenever passing the current scrolled value.|
|Font Styling|<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106734133/174872501-bc6e8d6e-8369-4a64-957a-925a42ea70bc.gif" alt="Font Styling" height="300" ><br>If the color of the font overlaps with other elements, only the overlapping part is changed to a different color. If it was the same as the original, `mix-blend-mode: difference`, `filter: invert(1)` would have changed the color when the background of the text was changed. However, in this case, I found that when I dragged the text, the dragged color was also inverted and changed to a strange color.<br><br>To fix this, I used `background-clip: text`, `background: linear-gradient(90deg, black 80%, white 0)` for the content and `-webkit-text-fill-color: transparent` for the text (Now the color is changed from the beginning regardless of the part overlapping the other element). Each time the window size changes, the value is calculated by `linear-gradient`, making it visually appear as if the color changes when overlapping the element.|
|Target Location|<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106734133/174901356-c62a3c76-1beb-4b4e-af5f-26dd6154c3e5.gif" alt="Target Location" height="300" /><br>Clicking on a poster card will turn on `modal` from the poster card's position.<br><br>To do this, get the clicked poster card as the value of `target` and calculate the values of `left`, `right`, `top`, `bottom`, `width`, and `height` through `target.getBoundingClientRect()`. If it succeeds in getting the position and size of the selected card, it creates a `modal` in the same size and position of that card.<br><br>After that it resets the size and position of the `modal` to the fixed values I set. Then set `transition-property: left, top, right, bottom, width, height` to see the animation effect of moving from the poster clicked by the user to the big screen.|
|Movie Slide|<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106734133/174715662-b8beddbd-a10e-450a-af44-73f292d9ed78.gif" alt="Movie Slide" height="100%" /><br>The user can slide to see the list of movies. There are 20 movie items fetched, divided into 5, each slide holds 4 movie items. If the user slides after reaching the last part of the slide, the current slide position is calculated and the next slide is moved to the first index slide.<br><br>How to calculate to move from the last slide index to the fisrt slide index:<br>`countCenter = left ? positionIdx === 0 ? 4 : positionIdx - 1 : positionIdx === 4 ? 0 : positionIdx + 1`<br><br>When the current slide position is 0, press the left button to move to slide index 4. If the current slide position value is not the first or last, this function is skipped.
|Show Lists|<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106734133/174692310-1bd4c05e-691b-43f6-96fd-e75189928e58.gif" alt="Show Lists" height="300" /><br>Press the button to display the title of the movie. This function has been added for users who require a simpler design.|
|Recommended Movie|<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106734133/174739085-9754dd2d-bb86-4b16-be78-8de551cb8b56.jpg" alt="Recommended Movie" height="200"/><br>This section recommends movies that will be released soon. Click the More Detail button to view movie information and click the refresh icon to recommend other movies.<br><br>A movie is recommended by randomly selecting one of the three genres clicked by the user and randomly selecting one from the movies of that genre. <br><br>An error occurs because there are no new movies coming out soon for some genres, so there is no value to load when that genre is selected. To prevent this, when a genre is selected and the fetched total result value is 0, a new genre is automatically selected again.|
|Image Loading|<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106734133/174716092-11d83db8-3e37-439a-8c59-b017e400967d.gif" alt="Image Loading" height="100%" /><br>If the image has not been downloaded when fetching the movie, the image will be downloaded. Then the Internet operation speed will be slow. To solve this, put the `filter: blur(20px)` style on the image before downloading. By adding blur, the download speed is faster because the device takes less burden on downloading images.<br><br>To do this, set it to `setImageLoading(true)` and change it to `setImageLoading(false)` when the download is finished.<br><br>Example:<br>```document.createElement('img').onload = function () {imageURL = this.src; setImageLoading(false);}```<br><br>In case of `setImageLoading && true`, the movie poster is displayed by removing the blur.|
|Fetch Loading|<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106734133/174740224-e37333f2-2e4b-429d-b263-c014062cbbe1.gif" alt="Fetch Loading" /><br>This is the loading screen displayed while fetching the movie. This prevents other pages from fetching the result value before the fetch is finished. Set `isLoading` to `true` for the item to be fetched, and change it to `false` if it is fetched. If isLoading is `true`, start the function that will work next. <br><br>Example:<br> `isLoading && false {...}`|
|Aside Styling|<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106734133/174692371-181bd4ac-a3db-41cb-9d2a-6661ab342636.jpg" alt="Aside Styling" height="300" /><br>I composed a design that visually connects the screens of `aside` and `main`. Styling the `:after` and `:before` of the `div` selected in `aside`. `div` has `relative` and `:after` and `:before` have `absolute` attribute to style the top and bottom corners within the `div`.|
|Sorting|<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106734133/174692315-0c36d4b6-8af4-4105-961f-927bf22dc075.jpg" alt="Sorting" /><br>Click the button in Sort By to change the URL to be fetched. It automatically detects when the URL changes and fetches a new one related to the one selected in Sort By.|
|Searching|<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106734133/174692302-982e9e37-6720-4e1f-899c-57190b3655c2.gif" alt="Searching" height="300" /><br>For a smooth server, `debounce` is used when making a search request. If a new value is not entered in `input` for 0.5 seconds, the value in `input` is requested from the server. When the input value is fetched, up to 8 recommended movies are displayed.<br><br> The `hasFocus` function is added to hide the recommended searched div when clicking outside the `div`. When the `div` is pressed again, the searched `div` is displayed.<br><br>When the user clicks on something in the recommended search, the `target value` of the `element` is retrieved and the movie is searched.|
|Aside Button|<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106734133/174692366-61a9e12a-cf1b-4b32-8f82-cd148554abfd.gif" alt="Aside Button" height="300" /><br>This is an aside menu that occurs when the window size becomes smaller. Clicking the left hamburger icon opens the menu, and the right arrow icon hides the aside menu to the left. When you click the icon button, smoothly changes to the next icon's form. I made the aside menu disappear when the current scroll reaches the `footer`, because it hides the text when the window scrolls to the bottom.|
|Movie Content|<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106734133/174739106-e41d62f6-4700-4b11-a479-cab34ddea297.jpg" alt="Movie Content" height="300" ><br>Click on the post card to display the movie's information as `modal`. This includes original title, genre, language, popularity, release date, votes, overview, and poster. To close `modal`, you need to click on the 'x' icon or click outside of the `modal`.<br><br>I used `useContext` to open this `modal`. Change `toggle` to `true` when clicking on a post.<br><br>Example:<br>`setContext({...context, displayMovie = true})`<br><br>Instruct `MoviePage.jsx` to open `modal` with `position: fixed` state whenever `context.displayMovie` is `true`.<br><br>Exmaple:<br>`context.displayMovie && {...}`<br><br>This will allow you to display the content of the movie whenever you click on a post on any page.|
|URL Searching|<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106734133/174904682-e5814a57-1972-4166-ac26-018c035b0eaa.gif" alt="URL Searching" height="300" /><br>You can search for a movie by entering the movie title in the URL. Use `useParams()` to enter the movie title in the `:id` part of `/movie/:id`. Then it will lists movies on the page by requesting the `:id` value from the server.<br><br>Web pages supported by GitHub cannot search for movies through URLs. URL search is not available on GitHub because the website I've created doesn't have a document that goes to the html file.<br><br>To use the URL searching feature, directly clone cinema-movie and use it at `http://localhost:3000/cinema-movie/movie/{:id}`.|
|Responsive|<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106734133/174692296-77b41909-4c5c-4d4b-8856-3da6c2e7fdfa.jpg" alt="Responsive" height="300" /><br>Because of the feature that shows 4 movies per slide, the poster may look very small when you see the poster through the mobile screen. So the styling I've chosen is to list two movies in two columns per slide.|

## That can be improved
- I need to improve the naming of files and folders so that other developers can see and understand their meaning at once.
- I need to learn more about which folder to put the files in.
- I need to make more reusable React Hooks and UI components of repetitive coding.
- In order to improve website speed, I should become more proficient in the usage of useState, useEffect, and rendering.
